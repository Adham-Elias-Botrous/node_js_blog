## About the ReactJS part:

The React JS in this application is simple. They are almost no props passed from a component to another. While mostly there is a Class Component in each React's file with events and request to the server.

# To run the application locally on your machine:

- Clone or download the repository
- Install the dependencies: for the Front-end and the Back-end, so in the Client folder and in the Root folder.
- Make a new file with the name .env in the root folder. It should contain values for these 3 variables: `PORT`,`DB_URL`,`JWT_SECRET`
- open the terminal in the root folder and run the command: `npm run dev` .Then Both the NodeJS server and React application will run.
